## ⚠️ RISK MANAGEMENT

**Bankroll:** £100 (assumed)  
**Max Risk per Bet:** 2% (£2.00)  
**Kelly Fraction:** 25% (conservative)  

**Why £5.73 stake on Royal Flush?**
- Full Kelly would suggest ~£23
- We use 25% Kelly for safety (£5.73)
- This is 5.7% of bankroll (higher than usual due to massive edge)

**If you're uncomfortable with 5.7% stake:**
- Reduce to £2.00 (2% bankroll) for more conservative approach
- Still excellent value, just smaller position size

## 🎲 PROBABILITY EXPLAINED

**Royal Flush Example:**
- **Market odds:** 10/1 = 9.1% implied probability
- **Model prediction:** 30.6% actual probability
- **Gap:** 21.5% (this is your edge)

**What this means:**
- If this race ran 100 times, Royal Flush would win ~31 times
- But you're getting paid as if it only wins 9 times
- Over time, this generates profit

## 📱 HOW TO BET
