*   **Outcome:** **LOSS**

*   **Result:** **9th** (Winner: Port Noir, 10.0 BSP)

*   **The Logic:**

*   **Result:** **2nd** (Winner: City Cyclone, 2.72 BSP)
*   **Outcome:** **LOSS**
*   **Post-Mortem:** Beaten a short head. The logic was sound, the result was unlucky.

*   **Selection:** **Al Najashi** (OR 59)
