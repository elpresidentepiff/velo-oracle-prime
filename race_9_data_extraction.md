## RUNNER #7: PURPLE RAINBOW @ 3.00
**Draw:** 2  
**Jockey:** Tom Marquand  
**Trainer:** William Haggas  
**Weight:** 9st-3lb  
**Age:** 3  
**Form:** 140478  
**RPR:** 93  
**Notes:** BF (Beaten Favorite), 5 star rating

**Spotlight:** Novice form was progressive, winning on AW at Kempton (1m) in January before finishing fourth in a strong race at Ascot; yet to shine in handicaps but testing ground may have been against her at Sandown last time and she's well treated on her novice form if the combination of a first-time tongue-tie and return to AW sparks a return to form.

**Last Run:** 9-4F (9-6) prominent early, in touch with leaders over 5f out, weakened over 2f out (trainer's rep said, regarding the poor form shown, that filly did not appreciate the going, officially described as soft, heavy in places, and would prefer a quicker surface) 8th of (10), 19L behind Sunlit Uplands (9-8) Sandown Rekorderlig Fillies' Handicap 4 in September.

**Recent Form:**
1. 12/09/25 SAN 7Sft Cl43yHcF,6K - 9-6, 8/10 19L, Sunlit Uplands[9/4F]9-8, RPR 37, OR 77

## RUNNER #2: LADY OF ARABIA @ 5.00
**Draw:** 1  
**Jockey:** Daniel Tudhope  
**Trainer:** Eve Johnson Houghton  
**Weight:** 9st-9lb  
**Age:** 5  
**Form:** 308933  
**RPR:** 88  
**Notes:** 3 star rating

**Spotlight:** Slipped down the weights this summer and back on form when twice third over C&D in blinkers (cheekpieces back on now) this autumn; 3yos won those two races and might be vulnerable to the younger generation for win purposes once again.

**Last Run:** 10-1 (9-9) midfield, steady headway from over 2f out, went third and kept on inside final 110yds 3rd of (13), 2½L behind Bin Ajwad (9-3) Southwell (AW) ARC £1Million Bonus Has £150K Increase! Handicap 4 in October.

**Recent Form:**
1. 03/10/25 STH 8St Cl4Hc,5K - 9-9, 3/13 2½L, Bin Ajwad[10/1]9-3, RPR 83, OR 77

## RUNNER #3: JAKARTA @ 7.00
**Draw:** 8  
**Jockey:** Benoit De La Sayette  
**Trainer:** Oliver Cole  
**Weight:** 9st-7lb  
**Age:** 3  
**Form:** 861-52  
**RPR:** 89  
**Notes:** 3 star rating

**Spotlight:** It took her a while to get back to the track this year but it hasn't taken her long to show she retains all her ability, going down by only a short head at Newmarket (1m) last time; same mark here but she was a disappointing odds-on favourite on her previous AW start.

**Last Run:** 18-1 (9-3) took keen hold, towards rear, headway on outer 2f out, ridden and hung right over 1f out, ran on inside final furlong, just failed 2nd of (9), shd behind Silent City (9-4) Newmarket Turners Fillies' Handicap 4 in September.

**Recent Form:**
1. 20/09/25 NMK 8Gd Cl4HcF,6K - 9-3, 2/9 shd, Silent City[18/1]9-4, RPR 83, OR 78
2. 12/09/25 SAN 7Sft Cl43yHcF,6K - 9-9, 5/10 6L, Sunlit Uplands[22/1]9-8, RPR 75, OR 80

## RUNNER #1: MADAME DE SEVIGNE @ 8.00
**Draw:** 7  
**Jockey:** Dylan Hogan  
**Trainer:** Darryll Holland  
**Weight:** 10st  
**Age:** 4  
**Form:** 062502  
**RPR:** 89  
**Notes:** 4 star rating

**Spotlight:** Dual 7f winner on turf; runner-up in both AW attempts, including at Chelmsford (1m) in August (final start for Robert Eddery); should be thereabouts if in similar form for new trainer (same owner).

**Last Run:** 11-1 (9-10) in touch with leaders, outpaced over 2f out, headway from over 1f out, ran on inside final furlong 2nd of (10), 1¼L behind Giant (8-12) Chelmsford (AW) Paddy Power Handicap 4 in August.

**Recent Form:**
1. 14/08/25 CFD 8St/Slw Cl4Hc,6K - 9-10, 2/10 1¼L, Giant[11/1]8-12, RPR 89, OR 81

## RUNNER #4: WONDERBOLT @ 8.00
**Draw:** 9  
**Jockey:** Clifford Lee  
**Trainer:** K R Burke  
**Weight:** 9st-6lb  
**Age:** 3  
**Form:** 686117  
**RPR:** 88  
**Notes:** 3 star rating

**Spotlight:** Scopey filly who came good in handicaps with 7f/1m wins at Newmarket in August; too free when stepped up to around 1m1f at York since and should be more at home back at shorter; unplaced all three AW starts but they were her qualifying runs.

**Last Run:** 11-2 (9-0) took keen hold, prominent, led home turn, headed 2f out, weakened quickly over 1f out (jockey said filly ran too free) 7th of (10), 7½L behind Rhapsody (9-6) York Sky Bet Build A Bet Fillies' Handicap 3 in September.

**Recent Form:**
1. 07/09/25 YOR 9Gd Cl3HcF,15K - 9-0, 7/10 7½L, Rhapsody[11/2]9-6, RPR 70, OR 77

## RUNNER #5: MOLLIE FOSTER @ 9.00
**Draw:** 6  
**Jockey:** Kieran Shoemark  
**Trainer:** Ed Walker  
**Weight:** 9st-5lb  
**Age:** 3  
**Form:** 048330  
**RPR:** 87  
**Notes:** 2 star rating

**Spotlight:** Her novice win at Haydock last summer (6f, good) was impressive but that remains her only win and the handicapper has held the aces so far this term; might be worth forgiving her latest run in a Class 2 event at the York Ebor meeting but others are more persuasive now tackling AW for the first time.

**Last Run:** 33-1 (8-8) midfield, slightly hampered over 1f out, soon no impression 10th of (18), 6¼L behind Royal Velvet (9-8) York British EBF Fillies' Handicap (Heritage Handicap) 2 in August.

**Recent Form:**
1. 21/08/25 YOR 7GF Cl2HcF,52K - 8-8, 10/18 6¼L, Royal Velvet[33/1]9-8, RPR 69, OR 77

## RUNNER #8: TRUE COLORS @ 9.50
**Draw:** 4  
**Jockey:** Marco Ghiani  
**Trainer:** Marco Botti  
**Weight:** 9st-3lb  
**Age:** 3  
**Form:** 331  
**RPR:** 85  
**Notes:** 3 star rating

**Spotlight:** Raced three times on AW in the spring, finishing third on first two starts before landing a 1m Chelmsford maiden; not obviously well treated but brings unexposed potential to her handicap debut after five months off.

**Last Run:** 6-4F (9-2) in touch with leaders, headway on outer from under 2f out, soon ridden, kept on to lead final strides, all out 1st of (12), ahead Al Durry (9-2) Chelmsford (AW) Racing Value At bet365 Maiden Fillies' Stakes (GBB Race) 5 in May.

**Recent Form:**
1. 22/05/25 CFD 8St Cl53yMdF,4K - 9-2, 1/12, Al Durry[6/4F]9-2, RPR 73
2. 28/04/25 WOL 9St Cl5MdF,4K - 9-1, 3/8 1¼L, Crepe Suzette[4/1]9-1, RPR 72

## SUMMARY

**Field Size:** 9 runners  
**Required Picks:** 3 picks (9 runners = 3 picks per field-size protocol)

**Favorites:**
1. Purple Rainbow @ 3.00 (William Haggas, Tom Marquand, 93 RPR)
2. Lady Of Arabia @ 5.00 (88 RPR, recent C&D 3rd places)
3. Jakarta @ 7.00 (89 RPR, just failed by short head last time)

**Betting Forecast Favorite:** Giant (nap) @ 11/4 - NOT IN VISIBLE RUNNERS (may be in earlier images)

**Key Observations:**
- Purple Rainbow is clear favorite with 93 RPR, top trainer/jockey combo
- Multiple runners have recent C&D form (Chelmsford AW)
- Several first-time AW runners (Mollie Foster, others)
- Madame De Sevigne was 2nd to "Giant" at C&D last time (Giant is forecast favorite)
- Revolutionise is CD winner with 2 tips
- Many 3yo fillies stepping into handicaps

**CRITICAL NOTE:** The betting forecast mentions "Giant" as NAP favorite @ 11/4, but Giant is NOT visible in the detailed runner cards shown. This suggests there may be additional runners or the forecast is from a different race. Need to clarify race details.
