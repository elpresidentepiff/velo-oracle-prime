CHELMSFORD CITY RESULTS - 2026-02-12

16:55 Valentines 'Hands And Heels' Apprentice Handicap
Winner: River Wharfe (or Al Baahy - snippet unclear, need to confirm)
Angelica K: 4th (Odds: 16/5)

18:30 Hearts And Hooves Handicap
Winner: Tryfan (1/1)
Carlton: 3rd (Odds: 5/2) - Snippet says "1 Tryfan, 2 Machete, 3 Carlton"

20:00 Chelmsford Mile Series Qualifier 6 Handicap
Kit Gabriel: Result pending/unknown from snippets (BBC snippet shows "4000-78" form, implies ran but result not clear yet, or race hasn't finished/resulted fully in snippets).
*Wait, BBC snippet says "Kit Gabriel... 11th of 11 runners" in Timeform snippet? No, Timeform snippet refers to a previous run (ISP 33/1).
Need to check 20:00 result specifically.

Analysis so far:
Angelica K (Prediction: Win/Place) -> Finished 4th. (Disappointment)
Carlton (Prediction: Win/Place) -> Finished 3rd. (Placed, but beaten by Tryfan and Machete)
Kit Gabriel -> Need to confirm result.

20:00 Chelmsford Mile Series Qualifier 6 Handicap
Status: Result not yet available/weighed in.
Kit Gabriel: Result pending.

Note: The 20:00 race result is not yet published on major sites (Sporting Life, Sky Sports). It might be delayed or just finished.
I will proceed with the analysis of the first two results (Angelica K and Carlton) and note Kit Gabriel as pending.
