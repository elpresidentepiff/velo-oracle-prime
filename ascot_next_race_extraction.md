- RPR 124 (2nd highest)
- Form 71-112 = won twice recently
- 2nd in Yorkshire Oaks (Group 1)
- Missed Arc due to scoping dirty (not form-related)
- **Potential overlay**

**2. QUISISANA @ 8.00**
- RPR 123 (tied 3rd highest)
- Form 1-1119 = 6 wins from 8 starts
- Won Group 1 at Deauville

- **Potential value**

**3. ONE LOOK @ 10.00**
- RPR 123 (tied 3rd highest)
- Form 126123 = very consistent
- Just beaten in Group 1 (3rd by 0.25L)
- 2 Group 3 wins this term
- **Solid value**

**4. LATAKIA @ 26.00**
- RPR 117 (decent)
- Form 19115 = 3 wins from 5 starts
- Won Group 2 at Deauville
- **Graffard/Buick combo**
- 26.00 seems generous
- **Longshot value**

### Red Flags:

- Last run: 7th in Arc (beaten 7L)

- ⭐5 rating suggests market confidence
- But RPR 119 is lower than top 5
- Won last time (Group 2) but at lower level
- **Might be overbet**

**3. DANIELLE @ 11.00**
- Gosden/Murphy elite connections
- But RPR 116 is low
- Form 922-24 = inconsistent
- **Connections might inflate price**

## NEXT STEPS

Need to:
1. Calculate weighted probability model (RPR + Form + Connections)
2. Compare to market odds
3. Identify Expected Value (EV) bets
4. Check trainer/jockey stats if available

---

**Preliminary Conclusion**:
- **Kalpana** is correctly top-rated (RPR 129) but recent form is poor (7th in Arc) - might be overbet
- **Estrange**, **Quisisana**, **One Look** all have strong ratings (122-124) and better recent form
- **Latakia** @ 26.00 with RPR 117 and Graffard/Buick looks like **value**
- **Waardah** @ 9.00 might be overbet (RPR 119, ⭐5 rating inflating price)
