## WHAT WENT WRONG

### 1. POWERFUL GLORY @ 201.00 WON
- FUT 100 = LOW rating (we ignored it)
- Trainer Richard Fahey: 7% last 14 days, -£7.50 overall (weak)
- Jockey Jamie Spencer: +£25.08 overall (profitable, but we didn't focus on this)
- **This was a 200/1 shock**

**Why We Missed It**:
- Our model focused on FUT ratings 107-120
- FUT 100 was too low to be considered
- This was an **outlier result** (200/1 longshots don't fit mathematical models)

### 2. LAZZAT @ 3.00 PLACED 2nd
- We said "PASS - no value" (-7% EV)
- It placed 2nd at 3.00f (favorite)
- **We were wrong to pass**

**Why We Missed It**:
- FUT 120 (highest rated) but we said "no value at 3.25"
- Model said 28.5% probability, market said 30.8%
- We calculated -7% EV and passed
- **But it still placed 2nd**

**Lesson**: Sometimes the favorite IS the right bet, even with marginal negative EV.

### 3. QUINAULT @ 67.00 PLACED 3rd
- We didn't bet this (it was in our "lottery ticket" category)
- FUT 108 = mid-tier
- Trainer Stuart Williams: 11% last 14 days, -£45.00 overall (weak)
- **We ignored it**

### 4. NO HALF MEASURES @ 29.00 PLACED 4th
- We bet this @ 26.00 EW (1% bank)
- It finished **4th** (just outside the EW places)
- **So close, yet so far**

**If it had finished 3rd**: We would have won the EW place portion.

---

## WHAT WENT RIGHT

### ✅ CORRECT AVOIDS

1. **Flora Of Bermuda @ 7.50** - We said "AVOID (overbet)" → **NOT PLACED** ✅
2. **Inisherin @ 11.00** - We said "AVOID (trainer 0-31)" → **NOT PLACED** ✅

**At least we didn't lose money on these.**

---

## ORACLE 2.0 ACCURACY

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| **Winning Picks** | 0/7 (0%) |
| **Correct Avoids** | 2/3 (Flora, Inisherin) |
| **Overall Accuracy** | 2/10 = **20%** |
| **ROI** | **-100%** |
| **Net Loss** | **-8.5% bank** |

## COMPARISON: ORACLE 2.0 vs REALITY

### Oracle 2.0 Top Pick:
- **Spy Chief @ 29.00** (Gosden/Buick elite connections)
- **Result**: NOT PLACED ❌

### What Actually Won:
- **Powerful Glory @ 201.00** (200/1 shock)
- **Oracle didn't even consider it** (FUT 100 too low)

### Oracle 2.0 Said to Avoid:
- **Lazzat @ 3.25** (no value)
- **Result**: 2nd ❌ (we were wrong)

---

## LESSONS LEARNED

### 1. 200/1 Shocks Happen
- **Powerful Glory @ 201.00** won
- FUT 100 = low rating
- Weak trainer/jockey stats
- **Mathematical models can't predict 200/1 shocks**

### 2. Sometimes the Favorite IS the Right Bet
- **Lazzat** was the favorite at 3.25
- We said "no value" (-7% EV)
- It placed 2nd
- **Lesson**: Don't always avoid favorites with marginal negative EV

### 3. Elite Connections Don't Always Win
- **Spy Chief** (Gosden/Buick 28%/34% last 14 days)
- We bet 2% bank on this
- **NOT PLACED**
- **Lesson**: Even elite connections fail

### 4. FUT Ratings Aren't Everything
- We focused on FUT 107-120
- **Powerful Glory** (FUT 100) won at 201.00
- **Lesson**: Low-rated horses can still win (especially at 200/1)

### 5. No Half Measures Finished 4th
- We bet this @ 26.00 EW
- It finished **4th** (just outside EW places)
- **Lesson**: We were close, but close doesn't pay

---

## WHAT SHOULD WE HAVE DONE?

### Option 1: Bet the Favorite
- **Lazzat @ 3.25** (FUT 120, highest rated)
- We said "no value" but it placed 2nd
- **If we'd bet 2% EW**: We'd have won the place portion

### Option 2: Include Powerful Glory
- **FUT 100** was too low for our model
- But **Jamie Spencer** was +£25.08 overall (profitable jockey)
- **If we'd included longshots with profitable jockeys**: We might have caught this

### Option 3: Wider EW Coverage
- We bet 7 horses EW
- **None placed**
- **If we'd spread wider** (10-12 horses): We might have caught Quinault (3rd) or No Half Measures (4th)

---

## FINAL VERDICT

### Oracle 2.0 Performance:
- **0/7 winning bets (0%)**
- **-8.5% bank loss**
- **-100% ROI**

### What Went Wrong:
1. **200/1 shock winner** (Powerful Glory) - mathematical models can't predict this
2. **Avoided the favorite** (Lazzat placed 2nd) - we were wrong
3. **Elite connections failed** (Spy Chief, Montassib, Witness Stand all lost)
4. **No Half Measures finished 4th** (just missed EW)

### What Went Right:
1. **Correctly avoided Flora Of Bermuda** (overbet, didn't place)
2. **Correctly avoided Inisherin** (trainer 0-31, didn't place)

## THE TRUTH

**Race 1 (1:30)**: Oracle 2.0 crushed it. Mission Central won, Ardisia placed 2nd. +224% ROI.

**Race 2 (2:05)**: Oracle 2.0 got destroyed. 200/1 shock winner. 0/7 bets hit. -100% ROI.

**Overall**: Still **+2.7% bank profit** across 2 races, but Race 2 was a disaster.

**Sometimes the math works. Sometimes a 200/1 shot wins and destroys your model.**

*"Powerful Glory @ 201.00. We never saw it coming."*
