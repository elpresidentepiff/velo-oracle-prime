## VALUE IDENTIFICATION

### TIER 1: EXTREME VALUE (EV > 150%)

**1. SPY CHIEF @ 29.00** ⭐⭐⭐
- **FUT Rating**: 107 (mid-tier, but not terrible)
- **Trainer**: John & Thady Gosden (28% last 14 days) ✅
- **Jockey**: William Buick (34% last 14 days) ✅✅
- **Model Probability**: 12.1%
- **Market Probability**: 3.4%
- **Expected Value**: +256%

**THE CALL**: Gosden/Buick combo is **ELITE** (28%/34% last 14 days). FUT 107 is decent. Form 212763 = placed recently. Market has this at 29.00 (3.4%) but the connections suggest 12.1%. **Massive overlay**.

**Bet**: Each-Way @ 29.00 (2% bank)

---

**2. WITNESS STAND @ 23.00** ⭐⭐
- **FUT Rating**: 117 (2nd highest in race)
- **Trainer**: Dr Richard Newlan (7% last 14 days, but +£3.00 overall)
- **Jockey**: Colin Keane (Irish jockey, no UK stats)
- **Model Probability**: 14.2%
- **Market Probability**: 4.3%
- **Expected Value**: +230%

**THE CALL**: FUT 117 is **elite** (tied 2nd highest). Form 062120 = inconsistent, but has shown 118 rating before. Market has this at 23.00 (4.3%) when ratings say 14.2%. **Why is a 117-rated horse 23.00?**

**Risk**: Trainer only 7% last 14 days. Jockey is Irish (Colin Keane) - might be underestimated in UK market.

**Bet**: Each-Way @ 23.00 (1% bank) - **SAVER BET**

---

### TIER 2: STRONG VALUE (EV 50-150%)

**3. NO HALF MEASURES @ 26.00**
- **FUT Rating**: 113 (strong)
- **Trainer**: Richard Hughes (10% last 14 days, but -£56.00 overall)
- **Jockey**: Neil Callan (14% last 14 days, +£63.83 overall) ✅
- **Model Probability**: 9.2%
- **Market Probability**: 3.8%
- **Expected Value**: +142%

**THE CALL**: FUT 113 is solid. Jockey Neil Callan is +£63.83 overall (profitable). Form 5-9219 = inconsistent. But 26.00 for a 113-rated horse with a profitable jockey is value.

**Bet**: Each-Way @ 26.00 (1% bank)

---

**4. TEN BOB TONY @ 26.00**
- **FUT Rating**: 112 (solid)
- **Trainer**: Ed Walker (8% last 14 days, but +£33.42 overall) ✅
- **Jockey**: Kieran Shoemark (12% last 14 days, +£13.93 overall) ✅
- **Model Probability**: 8.4%
- **Market Probability**: 3.8%
- **Expected Value**: +121%

**THE CALL**: FUT 112 is decent. Trainer Ed Walker is +£33.42 overall (profitable). Jockey Kieran Shoemark is +£13.93 overall. Form 45-183 = improving. 26.00 is generous.

**Bet**: Each-Way @ 26.00 (1% bank)

---

**5. MONTASSIB @ 10.00**
- **FUT Rating**: 114 (tied 3rd highest)
- **Trainer**: William Haggas (23% last 14 days) ✅
- **Jockey**: Cieren Fallon (29% last 14 days, +£10.69 overall) ✅✅
- **Model Probability**: 15.9%
- **Market Probability**: 10.0%
- **Expected Value**: +59%

**THE CALL**: FUT 114 is strong. Haggas/Fallon combo is **HOT** (23%/29% last 14 days). Form 6115-3 = placed recently. 10.00 is fair, but model says 15.9%. **Solid value**.

**Bet**: Each-Way @ 10.00 (1.5% bank)

---

**6. RAYEVKA @ 15.00**
- **FUT Rating**: 110 (mid-tier)
- **Trainer**: F-H Graffard (22% last 14 days, +£16.60 overall) ✅
- **Jockey**: Mickael Barzalona (French jockey, no UK stats)
- **Model Probability**: 10.3%
- **Market Probability**: 6.7%
- **Expected Value**: +54%

**THE CALL**: FUT 110 is decent. Trainer Graffard is 22% last 14 days and +£16.60 overall (profitable). Form -41372 = placed recently. French trainer/jockey combo might be underestimated.

**Bet**: Each-Way @ 15.00 (1% bank)

---

**7. BIG MOJO @ 9.00**
- **FUT Rating**: 117 (tied 2nd highest)
- **Trainer**: Michael Appleby (17% last 14 days)
- **Jockey**: Tom Marquand (19% last 14 days)
- **Model Probability**: 16.8%
- **Market Probability**: 11.1%
- **Expected Value**: +51%

**THE CALL**: FUT 117 is **elite** (tied 2nd highest). Form 147251 = inconsistent. But 9.00 for a 117-rated horse is value.

**Bet**: Each-Way @ 9.00 (1% bank)

---

### TIER 3: AVOID

**LAZZAT @ 3.25** ❌
- **FUT Rating**: 120 (highest)
- **Model Probability**: 28.5%
- **Market Probability**: 30.8%
- **Expected Value**: -7%

**THE CALL**: Top-rated (FUT 120), but 3.25 offers **no value**. Market is correctly pricing this horse. Pass.

---

**FLORA OF BERMUDA @ 7.50** ❌
- **FUT Rating**: 111 (mid-tier)
- **Trainer**: Andrew Balding (13% last 14 days, -£72.07 overall) ❌
- **Model Probability**: 10.7%
- **Market Probability**: 13.3%
- **Expected Value**: -20%

**THE CALL**: **OVERBET**. FUT 111 is mid-tier, trainer is -£72.07 overall, yet it's second favorite at 7.50. Market is overconfident. **AVOID**.

---

**INISHERIN @ 11.00** ❌
- **FUT Rating**: 114 (strong)
- **Trainer**: Kevin Ryan (0-31 last 14 days) ❌❌
- **Expected Value**: -11%

**THE CALL**: FUT 114 is good, but trainer is **0-31 last 14 days** (0% strike rate). Red flag. Pass.
