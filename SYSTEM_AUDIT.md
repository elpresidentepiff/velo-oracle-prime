- ❌ No error analysis accumulation
- ❌ No automated recalibration

---

### 3. **HOUSE AWARENESS & CYNICISM** ⚠️ CRITICAL

**Current State:** Naive - treats market as neutral  
**What's Missing:**

- ❌ Recognition that 1% profits from the 99%
- ❌ Awareness of favorite win rate manipulation
- ❌ Detection of "show races" vs "real races"
- ❌ Bookmaker profit margin tracking
- ❌ Public money vs sharp money differentiation
- ❌ Syndicate vs mug punter betting patterns

**The Oracle Doesn't Know:**
- ❌ That the house spreads wins across favorites to keep hope alive

**Should Sound Like:**
> "I see what they're doing. They've pushed the favorite to 2/1 to suck in public money, but the late drift on the 8/1 shot tells me the smart money knows something. This is a trap race. Stand down or back the drift."

**Currently Sounds Like:**
> "No clear signals detected. Market chaos prevails. Stand down."
