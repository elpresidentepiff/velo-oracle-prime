## ❌ AVOID

### **FIELD OF GOLD @ 2.62** (Favorite)
**Expected Value**: -16%

**The Data**:
- FUT 126 (HIGHEST by 8 points - massive advantage)
- **Trainer**: Gosden (28% last 14 days) ✅
- **Jockey**: Colin Keane (15% last 14 days)
- Form: -12114 (won last time)
- Model probability: 32.1% vs Market: 38.2%

**Why**: FUT 126 is **elite** (8 points clear of next best). Gosden is 28% last 14 days. Won last time. **BUT** the market has this at 2.62 (38.2% implied probability) when the model says 32.1%. **This is an overbet favorite.** The rating advantage is real, but 2.62 is **too short**. Should be 3.00-3.50.

**Verdict**: **PASS** - Overbet by 6.1 percentage points

---

### **NEVER SO BRAVE @ 8.00**
**Expected Value**: +8% (marginal)

**The Data**:
- FUT 117 (strong)
- **Trainer**: Andrew Balding (13% last 14 days, -£72.07 overall ❌❌)
- **Jockey**: Oisin Murphy (13% last 14 days)
- **Distance**: 1-1 (100%) ✅✅
- **Going**: 1-3 (33%) ❌
- Form: 0-2111

**Why**: FUT 117 is strong. 100% at this distance (1-1). **BUT** Balding is -£72.07 overall (losing trainer). Only 33% on this going. 8.00 is fairly priced but **no significant value**.

**Verdict**: **PASS** - Marginal value, losing trainer

---

### **MARVELMAN @ 41.00**
**Expected Value**: +89% (but risky)

**The Data**:
- FUT 115 (decent)
- **Trainer**: Andrew Balding (13% last 14 days, -£72.07 overall ❌❌)
- **Jockey**: P J McDonald
- Form: 129331 (inconsistent)

**Why**: FUT 115 at 41.00 looks like value on paper. **BUT** Balding is -£72.07 overall (losing trainer). Form is inconsistent. **Too risky.**

**Verdict**: **PASS** - Losing trainer, inconsistent form
