RAILWAY DEPLOYMENT - PYDANTIC V2 CONFIRMED
===========================================

This file confirms that the repository is configured for Pydantic v2.

requirements.txt contains:
- pydantic>=2.7,<3.0
- pydantic-settings>=2.0,<3.0

app/core/config.py uses:
- from pydantic_settings import BaseSettings
- model_config = SettingsConfigDict(...)

If Railway is still showing pydantic==1.10.13 errors, it means:
1. Railway is not pulling the latest code from GitHub
2. Railway's GitHub connection needs to be reconfigured
3. Railway may be using a cached or pinned commit
