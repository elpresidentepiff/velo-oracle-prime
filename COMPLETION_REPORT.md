## 🧪 Test Results

### **Full System Integration Test**

**Test Race:** Yarmouth 14:30 - Class 5 Handicap, 6f, Good

**Field:** 6 horses analyzed

**Results:**
- ✅ 3 horses passed all five filters
- ✅ Top Strike: Hidden Gem (10/1)
- ✅ Longshot Tactic: Lady Roisia (8/1)
- ✅ Speed Watch: Desert Storm (12/1)
- ✅ Confidence Index: 86/100
- ✅ Prediction logged to Scout Ledger
- ✅ Odds tracking active

**Rejected Horses:**
- ❌ Market Favorite (2.5/1) - Failed Filter 4 (too short)
- ❌ Long Shot Lucy (25/1) - Failed Filters 1 & 4 (poor form, too long)
- ❌ Swift Dancer (6/1) - Insufficient data

**Filter Performance:**
- Form Reality Check: Working correctly
- Intent Detection: Working correctly
- Sectional Suitability: Working correctly
- Market Misdirection: Working correctly (enforcing 3/1-20/1 range)
- Value Distortion: Working correctly
