# VÉLØ Research Protocol: The Dark Arts

## Phase 1: Research UK Handicap Manipulation
- [ ] Search for "UK horse racing handicap manipulation tactics"
- [ ] Search for "how trainers hide horses in UK handicaps"
- [ ] Search for "identifying non-triers in horse racing"
- [ ] Search for "betting market drift patterns for non-triers"
- [ ] Search for "release race signals UK racing"
- [ ] Analyze "The Gamble" and other exposés on racing coups.

## Phase 2: Develop Detection Logic
- [ ] Define "The Quiet Run" pattern (e.g., held up, never nearest, tenderly handled).
- [ ] Define "The Drift" pattern (e.g., 5.0 -> 12.0 in last 10 mins).
- [ ] Define "The Release" signals (e.g., Jockey Switch to Top Pro, Headgear On, Distance Change).
- [ ] Create `playbook_f_dark_arts.py` to implement this logic.

## Phase 3: Integration
- [ ] Integrate into Phoenix Protocol.
- [ ] Test against historical "coups" if data available.
