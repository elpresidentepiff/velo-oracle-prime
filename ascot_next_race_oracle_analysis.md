**Bet**: Each-Way @ 7.50 (1.5% bank)  
**Confidence**: 85/100

---

- **RPR**: 123 (tied 3rd highest)

### TIER 3: AVOID

**KALPANA @ 2.62 (Favorite)** ❌
- **RPR**: 129 (highest)
- **Form**: -32227 (hasn't won in 2024)
- **Last Run**: 7th in Arc de Triomphe - beaten 7L
- **Model Probability**: 26.5%
- **Market Probability**: 38.2%
- **Expected Value**: -31%

**THE CALL**: **OVERBET FAVORITE**. Yes, RPR 129 is highest. Yes, won this race last year. But hasn't won in 2024. Last run was 7th in Arc (beaten 7L). Market is pricing this at 2.62 (38.2%) when ratings and recent form say 26.5%. **This is a value trap**.

**Verdict**: **AVOID** - Market is betting on past performance, not current form.

---

**WAARDAH @ 9.00** ⚠️
- **RPR**: 119 (lower than top 5)
- **Form**: 15-411 (won last time - Group 2)
- **⭐5 rating** (market confidence)
- **Model Probability**: 14.8%
- **Market Probability**: 11.1%
- **Expected Value**: +33% (marginal)

**THE CALL**: Won last time (Group 2) but RPR 119 is lower than Estrange (124), Quisisana (123), One Look (123). ⭐5 rating suggests market confidence but might be inflating price. +33% EV is marginal.

**Verdict**: **PASS** - Not enough value for the risk.

---

**DANIELLE @ 11.00** ⚠️
- **RPR**: 116 (low)
- **Connections**: Gosden/Murphy (elite)
- **Form**: 922-24 (inconsistent)
- **Model Probability**: 11.2%
- **Market Probability**: 9.1%
- **Expected Value**: +23% (marginal)

**THE CALL**: Gosden/Murphy is elite but RPR 116 is low. Form 922-24 = inconsistent. +23% EV is marginal. Market might be inflating price based on connections.

**Verdict**: **PASS** - Connections don't justify the price.
