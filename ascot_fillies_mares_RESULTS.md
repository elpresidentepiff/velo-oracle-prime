## PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS

### ✅ WINS

**1. ESTRANGE @ 7.50 (EW) - 2nd Place**
- **Oracle Prediction**: "Strong value, +64% EV, smart money on Betfair"
- **Actual Result**: 2nd @ 7.00
- **Returns** (2% bank EW):
  - Place portion (1/5 odds): 7.50 / 5 = 1.50 → 1.50 × 2% = **3% profit**
  - (Actually paid at 7.00, so: 7.00 / 5 = 1.40 → 1.40 × 2% = **2.8% profit**)

**2. QUISISANA @ 8.00 (EW) - 3rd Place**
- **Oracle Prediction**: "Strong value, +84% EV, RPR 123, G1 winner"
- **Actual Result**: 3rd @ 7.00
- **Returns** (1.5% bank EW):
  - Place portion (1/5 odds): 8.00 / 5 = 1.60 → 1.60 × 1.5% = **2.4% profit**
  - (Actually paid at 7.00, so: 7.00 / 5 = 1.40 → 1.40 × 1.5% = **2.1% profit**)

### ❌ LOSSES

**1. ONE LOOK @ 10.00 (EW) - NOT PLACED**

- **Actual Result**: Not placed
- **Loss**: 2.5% bank

**2. LATAKIA @ 26.00 (EW) - NOT PLACED**
- **Oracle Prediction**: "Biggest overlay, +306% EV, Graffard/Buick elite"
- **Actual Result**: Not placed
- **Loss**: 2% bank

**3. WEMIGHTAKEDLONGWAY @ 12.00 (EW) - NOT PLACED**
- **Oracle Prediction**: "Strong value, +161% EV, just beaten 0.5L in G1"

---

### ❌ BIGGEST MISTAKE

**KALPANA @ 2.62 - AVOIDED**
- **Oracle Prediction**: "AVOID - overbet favorite, -31% EV, hasn't won in 2024"
- **Actual Result**: **WON @ 2.37f**
- **What We Missed**: Kalpana won this race last year. Despite not winning in 2024 and finishing 7th in the Arc, it **won today**.

**Why We Were Wrong**:
- We focused on recent form (7th in Arc)
- We said "market is betting on past performance" and avoided
- But the market was **right** - Kalpana won

**Lesson**: Sometimes the favorite IS the right bet, even with poor recent form. Course/distance specialists (won this race last year) can bounce back.

## WHAT WENT WRONG

### 1. KALPANA WON (We Avoided It)
- We said "AVOID - overbet favorite, -31% EV"
- We focused on recent form (7th in Arc, hasn't won in 2024)
- But Kalpana **won this race last year** (course/distance specialist)
- **Market was right, we were wrong**

**Lesson**: Don't always avoid favorites with poor recent form if they're course/distance specialists.

### 2. ONE LOOK DIDN'T FIRE
- We made this our **top pick** (2.5% bank)
- RPR 123, just beaten 0.25L in Group 1
- But it **didn't place**
- **Lost 2.5% bank**

### 3. LATAKIA DIDN'T FIRE
- We called this the "biggest overlay" (+306% EV)
- Graffard/Buick elite connections
- But it **didn't place**
- **Lost 2% bank**

### 4. WEMIGHTAKEDLONGWAY DIDN'T FIRE
- Just beaten 0.5L in Group 1 (same race as One Look)
- But it **didn't place**
- **Lost 2% bank**

### 5. BEDTIME STORY DIDN'T FIRE
- O'Brien filly, RPR 122
- But it **didn't place**
- **Lost 1.5% bank**

---

## WHAT WENT RIGHT

### ✅ ESTRANGE PLACED 2nd
- We backed this @ 7.50 EW (2% bank)
- We said "smart money on Betfair" (Betfair shortened to 7.2)
- It placed **2nd @ 7.00**
- **+2.8% profit**

### ✅ QUISISANA PLACED 3rd
- We backed this @ 8.00 EW (1.5% bank)
- RPR 123, won Group 1 at Deauville
- It placed **3rd @ 7.00**
- **+2.1% profit**

### ✅ CORRECTLY AVOIDED WAARDAH & DANIELLE
- Both didn't place
- We saved money by passing on these

## COMPARISON: ORACLE 2.0 vs REALITY

### Oracle 2.0 Top Pick:

- **Result**: NOT PLACED ❌

- **Kalpana @ 2.37f** (favorite)

## LESSONS LEARNED

### 1. Don't Always Avoid Favorites
- **Kalpana** was the favorite at 2.62
- We said "AVOID - overbet, -31% EV"
- But it **won**
- **Lesson**: Course/distance specialists (won this race last year) can bounce back even with poor recent form

### 2. High EV Picks Don't Always Win
- **Latakia** (+306% EV), **Wemightakedlongway** (+161% EV), **One Look** (+158% EV)
- All had high EV but **none placed**
- **Lesson**: High EV is correct long-term, but individual races can still lose

### 3. Each-Way Betting Saved Us
- **Estrange** and **Quisisana** both placed (2nd and 3rd)
- EW coverage meant we got **+4.9% back** even with 4 losers
- **Without EW**: We'd have lost 11.5% bank
- **With EW**: We lost 6.6% bank

### 4. Smart Money Indicator Worked
- **Estrange** had smart money (Betfair shortened to 7.2)
- We backed it @ 7.50 EW
- It placed **2nd**
- **Lesson**: Smart money indicators (Betfair movements) are valuable

### 5. Betfair Data Helped
- We identified that **One Look**, **Wemightakedlongway**, **Bedtime Story** drifted on Betfair
- We took bookmaker prices instead
- But they still didn't place
- **Lesson**: Betfair data helps identify value, but doesn't guarantee winners

## THE TRUTH

**Race 1 (1:30)**: Oracle 2.0 crushed it. Mission Central won, Ardisia placed 2nd. +224% ROI. ✅✅

**Race 2 (2:05)**: Oracle 2.0 got destroyed. 200/1 shock winner. -100% ROI. ❌❌

**Race 3 (Fillies & Mares)**: Oracle 2.0 got 2 places (Estrange 2nd, Quisisana 3rd) but avoided the winner (Kalpana). -57% ROI. ❌

**Overall**: **-3.9% bank loss** across 3 races. **44% accuracy**.

---

## FINAL VERDICT

### What Worked:
✅ Smart money detection (Estrange placed 2nd)  
✅ Each-way betting (saved us from total loss)  
✅ Correctly avoided some non-placers (Waardah, Danielle)  

### What Didn't Work:
❌ Avoided the winner (Kalpana)  
❌ Top picks didn't fire (One Look, Latakia, Wemightakedlongway)  
❌ High EV picks lost (4/6 bets lost)  

### Key Mistake:
**We avoided Kalpana** (the favorite) because of poor recent form. But it won. Course/distance specialists can bounce back.

---

**Oracle 2.0 is learning. Race 1 was brilliant. Race 2 was a disaster. Race 3 was mixed. Overall: -3.9% bank, 44% accuracy.**

*"Estrange placed 2nd. Quisisana placed 3rd. But we avoided the winner. That's the lesson."*
