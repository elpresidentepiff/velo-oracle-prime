- Setup runs

### Maiden
**Characteristics:**
- No winners yet
- High uncertainty
- Unknown ceiling
- Market can be wrong both ways

**Analysis Focus:**
- Potential over form
- Trainer patterns
- Breeding
- Workout reports

### Novice

- Winners allowed but developing
- More evidence than maiden
- Still uncertain
- Market learning

**Analysis Focus:**
- Improvement trajectory
- Experience gained
- Class assessment
- Conditions fit

### Conditions/Group
**Characteristics:**
- Quality rises
- Intent clearer
- Value edges smaller
- Market efficient

**Analysis Focus:**
- Class assessment
- Pace scenarios
- Track bias
- Fine margins

### Claimers/Sellers
**Characteristics:**
- Messy incentives
- Variable intent
- Chaos common
- Low liquidity

**Analysis Focus:**
- Incentive analysis
- Intent signals
- Market manipulation
- Avoid unless edge massive

## All-Weather (AW)

### Surface Characteristics
- **Polytrack:** Consistent, speed-favoring
- **Tapeta:** Similar to Polytrack
- **Fibresand:** Different kickback, stamina-favoring

### Track Geometry
- **Tight turns:** Position critical
- **Long straights:** Stamina test
- **Undulations:** Balance matters
- **Draw geometry:** Positional wars

### Specialist Horses
- **AW-only horses:** Often mispriced on turf
- **Surface switchers:** Intent signals
- **Going versatility:** Rare and valuable

### Going Impact
- **AW going:** More consistent than turf
- **Weather impact:** Less than turf
- **Energy cost:** Still significant

## National Hunt (NH)

### Additional Variables

#### Fitness
- **Peak fitness:** 2nd/3rd run after break
- **Fitness decline:** After hard race
- **Seasonal patterns:** Some yards time perfectly

#### Jumping Fluency
- **Clear round:** Essential
- **Jump errors:** Costly
- **Jump style:** Some tracks suit

#### Stamina
- **Stamina test:** Long trips
- **Speed vs stamina:** Balance matters
- **Trip suitability:** Critical

#### Education Runs
- **Real tactic:** Not just poor form
- **Learning:** Jumping experience
- **Ready to explode:** Next time

### NH Race Types

#### Hurdles
- **Speed-based:** Short trips
- **Jumping:** Essential
- **Pace:** Often contested

#### Chases
- **Stamina-based:** Longer trips
- **Jumping:** Critical
- **Pace:** More tactical

#### Bumpers
- **Flat racing on jumps track**
- **No jumping**
- **Experience building**

## Cross-Type Analysis

### When to Apply Which Assumptions

#### Flat → AW
- **Keep:** Ability, intent, pace
- **Adjust:** Track geometry, specialist horses
- **Watch:** Surface switchers

#### Flat → NH
- **Keep:** Intent, class
- **Adjust:** Fitness, jumping, stamina
- **Watch:** Education runs

#### AW → Flat
- **Keep:** Ability, intent
- **Adjust:** Going impact, track bias
- **Watch:** Surface switchers

#### NH → Flat
- **Keep:** Intent, class
- **Adjust:** Fitness, stamina
- **Watch:** Jumping experience

## Output Requirements

### Must Include:
1. **Race type classification** (Flat/AW/NH + subtype)
2. **Type-specific factors** (surface, going, jumping)
3. **Cross-type adjustments** (what changes)
4. **Specialist horses** (surface/track specialists)
5. **Type-specific traps** (common errors)

### Language:
- Type-specific terminology
- Conditional statements
- Comparative analysis
- Evidence-based
