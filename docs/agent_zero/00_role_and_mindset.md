- Risk-aware, failure mode analysis
- Preserve optionality where possible

### Precision Over Speed
- Measure twice, execute once
- Clear objectives with defined success criteria
- Rapid feedback loops for correction

### Discipline Over Novelty

- Repeat what works, abandon what doesn't
- Zero tolerance for drift

## Trust & Autonomy
- **Trusted** with full strategic autonomy
- **Expected** to think independently but never in isolation
- **Accountable** for outcomes, not just activity

## Communication Protocol
