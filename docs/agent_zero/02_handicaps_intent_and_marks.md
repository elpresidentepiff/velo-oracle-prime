# Handicaps: Intent Detection & Mark Management

## The Handicap Game

### Handicap Marks as Currency
Handicap marks are the primary battlefield for value. Humans manage them strategically.

### Key Concepts

#### Well-Handicapped
A horse is **better than its current mark**. Often hidden by:
- Setup runs (conservative rides)
- Wrong conditions (trip/ground)
- Traffic/pace issues
- Jockey tactics

#### Mark Protection
Horses may run over **wrong trip/ground** or with **conservative rides** to:
- Keep mark low
- Avoid weight escalation
- Preserve future options

#### Reactivation Pattern
Look for:
1. Return to best conditions
2. Strong rider booked
3. Mark at/below last win mark
4. Recent break (freshness)

## Intent Signals (2+ = Live)

### Primary Intent Indicators

#### 1. Class Drop
- Moving down in class
- Often with jockey upgrade
- Market may not reflect full intent

#### 2. Surface Switch
- Turf to AW or vice versa
- Specialist horse returning to preferred surface
- Market slow to adjust

#### 3. Jockey Upgrade
- Top jockey booked
- Especially on non-favourite
- Indicates confidence

#### 4. Trip/Distance Change
- Moving to optimal distance
- Often with conditions improvement
- Setup for specific race shape

#### 5. Yard Timing
- 2nd/3rd run after break (peak fitness)
- Specific meeting targets
- Repeat patterns from past success

#### 6. Multiple Runners
- Decoy dynamics
- One horse sets pace, another closes
- Market focuses on wrong one

#### 7. Mark Compression
- At/below last win mark
- Weight advantage
- Re-asserting dominance

#### 8. Recent Form Excuse
- Last run: wrong trip, traffic, pace collapse
- Not reflected in OR
- Ready to rebound

## Mark Analysis Framework

### Step 1: Calculate True Ability
```
True Ability = OR + Recent Form Adjustment + Conditions Fit + Intent Bonus
```

### Step 2: Compare to Market
```
Market Implied % vs True Ability %
```

### Step 3: Intent Weighting
```
Live Score = Base Score × (1 + 0.2 × Intent Signals)
```

## Common Handicap Traps

### False Well-Handicapped
- Horse appears well-handicapped but conditions are wrong
- Mark protected, not earned
- No genuine intent signals

### Mark Inflation
- OR rising faster than ability
- Market overweights recent success
- Value disappears

### Setup Run Deception
- Conservative ride masked as poor ability
- Wrong conditions deliberately
- Ready to explode next time

## Detection Rules

### Rule 1: Intent Corroboration
Never trust single intent signal. Need 2+ with:
- Conditions fit
- Pace scenario compatible
- Market not fully adjusted

### Rule 2: Mark Trajectory
- Falling mark = improving horse
- Stable mark = consistent
- Rising mark = declining or mark protection

### Rule 3: Recent Form Context
- Last 3 runs: pattern analysis
- Excuses vs genuine decline
- Consistency over flash

## Output Requirements

### Must Include:
1. **Intent signals detected** (count and type)
2. **Mark analysis** (current vs true ability)
3. **Conditions fit** (going/trip/track)
4. **Market read** (price action, liquidity)
5. **Threats** (what can break the model)

### Language:
- No hype
- Evidence-based
- Scenario probabilities
- Risk bands
