# RACE INTELLIGENCE CHECKLIST
## Commander Zero - Phase 1 Foundation

### 1. MINDSET LOCK (Before Any Analysis)
- [ ] **CEO-level thinking**: Execute, coordinate, accelerate, monetise
- [ ] **Intensity without recklessness**: High agency, risk-aware
- [ ] **Precision over speed**: Measure twice, execute once
- [ ] **Discipline over novelty**: Doctrine first, zero drift
- [ ] **Evidence required**: Every claim needs supporting data
- [ ] **No hype language**: Use probabilities, not certainties
- [ ] **Threat identification**: Every analysis must include threats

### 2. RACE CONTEXT & CLASSIFICATION
- [ ] **Race type identified**: Flat/AW/NH + subtype (Handicap/Maiden/Novice/Group/Claimer)
- [ ] **Conditions documented**: Going, distance, track geometry
- [ ] **Field size noted**: Impact on traffic and pace
- [ ] **Quality assessment**: Class level and competitive depth

### 3. THE FOUR PRIMARY LEVERS (Must Analyze All)

#### A) ABILITY (True Current Ability)
- [ ] **OR (Official Rating)**: Handicapper's view, foundation
- [ ] **RPR/TS**: External ratings, context-sensitive
- [ ] **Recent form**: Last 3 runs pattern analysis
- [ ] **Effort vs finish**: Look for hidden quality
- [ ] **Excuses identified**: Wrong setup, traffic, pace issues

#### B) CONDITIONS FIT
- [ ] **Going impact**: Soft/heavy changes energy cost massively
- [ ] **Surface specialization**: AW vs Turf vs NH specialists
- [ ] **Trip suitability**: Speed vs stamina demands (nonlinear)
- [ ] **Track geometry**: Tight turns, long straights, undulations, draw

#### C) PACE & POSITION (Non-Negotiable)
- [ ] **Early leaders identified**: 2+ front-run attempts in last 5 runs
- [ ] **Pressure points mapped**: Who contests whom
- [ ] **Scenario assigned**: S2/S3/S4/S8 with probability
- [ ] **Closers' chance assessed**: Will they get a run?
- [ ] **Traffic likelihood**: Field size, track type, hold-up horses

#### D) INTENT (Human Layer)
- [ ] **Intent signals count**: Need 2+ for live horse
- [ ] **Class drop detected**: Moving down with jockey upgrade
- [ ] **Surface switch**: Specialist returning to preferred surface
- [ ] **Jockey upgrade**: Top rider on non-favourite
- [ ] **Yard timing**: 2nd/3rd run after break
- [ ] **Multiple runners**: Decoy dynamics
- [ ] **Mark compression**: At/below last win mark
- [ ] **Recent form excuse**: Ready to rebound

### 4. HANDICAP ANALYSIS
- [ ] **Well-handicapped check**: Better than mark?
- [ ] **Mark protection detection**: Wrong conditions to keep mark low
- [ ] **Reactivation pattern**: Return to best conditions + strong rider
- [ ] **Mark trajectory**: Falling = improving, Stable = consistent, Rising = declining
- [ ] **True ability calculation**: OR + form adjustment + conditions + intent bonus

### 5. PACE SCENARIOS (Four Primary)

#### S4: CONTROLLED THEFT
- [ ] **Detection**: Single early leader, no pressure
- [ ] **Probability**: Calculate %
- [ ] **Risk**: Pace collapse, bias against, stamina limits

#### S3: COLLAPSE & SWEEP
- [ ] **Detection**: 3+ front-runners, high pressure
- [ ] **Probability**: Calculate %
- [ ] **Risk**: Lone leader survives, traffic for closers

#### S2: TACTICAL GRIND
- [ ] **Detection**: 1-2 leaders, moderate pressure
- [ ] **Probability**: Calculate %
- [ ] **Risk**: Pace too slow/fast, bias interference

#### S8: CHAOS
- [ ] **Detection**: Large field, tight track, low liquidity
- [ ] **Probability**: Calculate %
- [ ] **Risk**: Unpredictable, high variance

### 6. TRACK BIAS ANALYSIS
- [ ] **Bias is conditional**: Good IF it interacts with pace/geometry
- [ ] **Recent results**: Last 5 races analyzed
- [ ] **Rail position**: Inside vs outside advantage
- [ ] **Weather impact**: Wind, rain affecting bias
- [ ] **Field size effect**: Traffic patterns
- [ ] **Harrowing check**: Track maintenance impact

### 7. MARKET MICROSTRUCTURE (Betfair)

#### Market Behavior Type
- [ ] **Organic drift**: Gradual, consistent liquidity
- [ ] **Informed drift**: Persistent weakness, negative flow
- [ ] **False steam**: Sudden spike, low volume, reverses
- [ ] **Price resilience**: Stable despite negatives (intent smell)

#### Exchange Primitives
- [ ] **Back/lay spread**: Tight (1-2 ticks) vs Wide (5+ ticks)
- [ ] **Depth/ladder**: Spoofing detection, held prices
- [ ] **Matched volume**: Liquidity quality, market confidence
- [ ] **BSP comparison**: Model vs crowd belief

#### Market Traps
- [ ] **False favourite**: Hype + pace vulnerability
- [ ] **Stable decoy**: Multiple runners, wrong one supported
- [ ] **Jockey trap**: Big name on dead profile
- [ ] **Prep run disguise**: Conservative ride, "not asked"
- [ ] **Data mirage**: Inflated figure from perfect setup

### 8. OUTPUT STRUCTURE (Minimum Requirements)
- [ ] **Race context**: Type, conditions, field
- [ ] **Pace scenario**: S2/S3/S4/S8 with probability
- [ ] **Intent signals**: Count and type (if any)
- [ ] **Bias/conditions**: Relevance and impact
- [ ] **Market read**: Behavior type, liquidity, price action
- [ ] **Threats list**: What can break the model
- [ ] **Risk band**: Low/Medium/High

### 9. LANGUAGE DISCIPLINE
- [ ] **Prohibited**: "Guaranteed", "Sure thing", "Must win", "Lock", "Just trust"
- [ ] **Required**: "Scenario likelihood", "Risk band", "Evidence suggests", "Conditional on"
- [ ] **Tone**: Professional, analytical, precise, humble

### 10. POST-RACE LEARNING
- [ ] **Expected vs actual**: Scenario comparison
- [ ] **Assumption failures**: Pace/Bias/Intent/Traffic/Fitness
- [ ] **Pattern tag**: Type and name
- [ ] **Principle extraction**: General rule
- [ ] **Memory storage**: UUID, timestamp, tags
