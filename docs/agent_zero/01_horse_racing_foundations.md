# Horse Racing Deep Dive - Foundations

## Core Definition
Horse racing is a **handicapped, condition-driven, pace-shaped contest** where humans (trainers/jockeys/owners) optimize for **timing**, while the market tries to price that intent.

## Race Taxonomy (Must Internalize)

### Flat Racing
- **Handicap:** Weights assigned to equalize chances. Primary battlefield for mispricing and intent runs.
- **Maiden:** No winners yet. High uncertainty. "Unknown ceiling" dominates.
- **Novice:** Winners allowed but still developing. More evidence than maiden.
- **Conditions/Group:** Quality rises, intent clearer, value edges smaller.
- **Claimers/Sellers:** Messy incentives, variable intent, chaos common.

### All-Weather (AW)
- Surface and track geometry matter critically
- Some horses are specialists (AW-only)
- Going changes energy cost massively

### National Hunt (NH)
- Adds: fitness, jumping fluency, stamina, education runs
- "Education runs" are a real tactic
- Fitness and jumping are primary variables

## The Four Primary Levers

### A) Ability (True Current Ability)
- **Ratings:** OR (handicap mark), RPR/TS (external speed/ratings)
- **Private stable knowledge** (not public)
- **Effort better than finish** - look for hidden quality
- **Wrong setup last time** - excuse for poor performance

### B) Conditions Fit
- **Going:** Soft/heavy changes energy cost massively
- **Surface:** AW vs Turf vs NH
- **Trip:** Speed vs stamina demands (nonlinear)
- **Track:** Tight turns, long straights, undulations, draw geometry

### C) Pace and Position
- **Race shape** is the skeleton
- **Lone lead** can steal
- **3+ leaders** can collapse
- **Hold-up** can die in traffic
- **Pace map** is not optional

### D) Intent (Human Layer)
- **Class drops, surface switches, jockey upgrades**
- **Setup run vs cash run** patterns
- **Yard timing:** 2nd/3rd run after break, specific meetings
- **Multiple runners:** Decoy dynamics exist

## Handicaps: The Real Game

### Handicap Marks as Currency
- **Well-handicapped:** Better than mark (hidden by setup runs)
- **Mark protection:** Running over wrong trip/ground to keep mark
- **Reactivation pattern:** Return to best conditions + strong rider + mark compression

### Intent Signal Rule
If you see **2+ intent signals** on a runner, treat as live regardless of market rank.

## Speed/Ratings: What Matters

### OR (Official Rating)
- Handicapper's view
- Slow-moving, exploitable
- Foundation for analysis

### RPR/TS
- Useful anchors but context-sensitive
- Pace/setup can inflate figures
- **Never read a figure without reading how it was earned**

## Learning Loop

### Post-Race Analysis
1. Expected scenario vs actual
2. Which assumption failed?
   - Pace?
   - Bias?
   - Intent?
   - Traffic?
   - Fitness?
3. Tag pattern and store as principle

### Continuous Improvement
- Every cycle refines the engine
- Memory as learning, not sentiment
- Pattern extraction over narrative

## Key Principles

1. **Structure over narrative** - Trust the framework
2. **Scenario likelihoods** - Speak in probabilities
3. **Risk bands** - Define downside
4. **No single datapoint dominance** - Multi-factor analysis
5. **Discipline is a feature** - Not a mood
