---

## FINAL RANKINGS & COMPOSITE SCORES

### 1. **EL BUFALO** @ 34.00 - ✓ RECOMMENDED
**Composite Score: 61.3/100**  
**Filters Passed: 4/4** ✓✓✓✓

- SQPE: 40/100 (Solid going form - 33% win rate)
- Value Edge: **+37.1%** (Massive overlay)
- Risk Score: 0 (Clean)
- Form Score: 30/100 (Recent win)

**Analysis:** The dark horse of the race. El Bufalo's 33% going win rate is being completely ignored by the market at 34.00. Recent win shows he's in form, and the going suits perfectly. This is a **classic value longshot** - the type that pays for the entire system when it comes in.

**⚠ VELO'S TAKE:** "This is the ghost in the machine. 34.00 for a horse that wins 1 in 3 on this surface? The crowd's sleeping. But remember - we're not betting the win here, we're betting the mathematics. This is a saver bet, not a savior bet."

---

### 2. **TYGER BAY** @ 5.00 - ✓ RECOMMENDED (MARKET FAVORITE ★)
**Composite Score: 61.2/100**  
**Filters Passed: 3/4** ✓✓✓

- SQPE: 60/100 (Excellent course/going/distance record)
- Value Edge: **+40.0%** (Still underpriced despite being favorite)
- Risk Score: 15 (Jockey 0% L14 - minor concern)
- Form Score: 15/100 (Not peak form but consistent)

**Analysis:** The market favorite, and deservedly so. 20% course win rate, 21% going win rate, 18% distance win rate - this horse **knows this track**. The only concern is jockey Ryan Kavanagh's 0% strike rate in last 14 days, but the horse's class should overcome this.

**⚠ VELO'S TAKE:** "The favorite that's still value - rare as hen's teeth. But here's the rub: favorites at 5.00 don't stay favorites. If this drifts to 6.00 or 7.00, that's the house telling you something. Watch the late money."

---

### 3. **MC LOVEN** @ 9.00 - ✓ RECOMMENDED
**Composite Score: 60.2/100**  
**Filters Passed: 3/4** ✓✓✓

- SQPE: 30/100 (No course/going form - **RED FLAG**)
- Value Edge: **+18.9%** (Good value)
- Risk Score: -20 (Excellent - hot trainer 29% L14)
- Form Score: 40/100 (Improving +4.7 speed figures)

**Analysis:** The improver. Mc Loven has **no course or going experience** which is concerning, but trainer Simon Dow is **29% strike rate in last 14 days** and the speed figures are climbing (+4.7). High-class best recent figure of 81 shows the ability is there.

**⚠ VELO'S TAKE:** "Hot trainer, improving horse, no track experience. This is a 'trust the yard' play. Dow's 29% L14 means he's placing horses to win. But that zero course form? That's the price you pay for 9.00. I'm in, but cautiously."

---

### 4. **HARRY'S HALO** @ 19.00 - ✓ RECOMMENDED
**Composite Score: 59.2/100**  
**Filters Passed: 3/4** ✓✓✓

- SQPE: 30/100 (Minimal course/going form)
- Value Edge: **+24.7%** (Strong value)
- Risk Score: 5 (Low risk)
- Form Score: 50/100 (Recent win, consistent, but declining figures)

**Analysis:** The each-way special. Recent win, consistent placings, no poor runs. The 17% distance win rate (4 from 23) is solid. Declining speed figures (-4.0) are a concern, but from a high base. At 19.00, this is **each-way value**.

**⚠ VELO'S TAKE:** "This is what we call a 'place thief.' Won't win, but will be there or thereabouts. At 19.00, we're playing the place dividend. The declining figures worry me, but recent win says there's still juice in the tank."

---

### 5. **ONE MORE DREAM** @ 15.00 - ✓ RECOMMENDED
**Composite Score: 58.8/100**  
**Filters Passed: 3/4** ✓✓✓

- SQPE: 60/100 (40% going win rate - **EXCELLENT**)
- Value Edge: **+53.3%** (Highest value in race)
- Risk Score: 0 (Clean)
- Form Score: -20/100 (Multiple poor runs - **MAJOR CONCERN**)

**Analysis:** The enigma. **40% going win rate and 23% distance win rate** are outstanding, giving this horse the **highest value edge in the race (+53.3%)**. But the form is terrible - multiple poor runs recently. This is a **pure statistical play**.

**⚠ VELO'S TAKE:** "The numbers scream 'back me' but the form screams 'run away.' This is the bet that separates system players from gut players. I trust the 40% going record over recent form, but I'm not loading up. Small stake, big potential."

---

### 6. **INVINCIBLE SPEED** @ 10.00 - ✓ RECOMMENDED
**Composite Score: 54.8/100**  
**Filters Passed: 3/4** ✓✓✓

- SQPE: 25/100 (Weak course/going form)
- Value Edge: **+15.0%** (Moderate value)
- Risk Score: 20 (Moderate - trainer 0% L14)
- Form Score: 60/100 (Best form in race - recent win, improving)

**Analysis:** The form horse. **Best form score in the race (60/100)** with recent win, consistent placings, and high-class speed figure of 80. The problem? **No course form (0 from 2)** and trainer D M Loughnane is **0% in last 14 days**. This is a **form vs. statistics** clash.

**⚠ VELO'S TAKE:** "Best recent form, worst trainer stats. This is the horse that looks good on paper but the yard's cold. I'm borderline on this one. If you're betting, it's an each-way safety play, not a win conviction."

---

## REJECTED HORSES (Did Not Meet System Criteria)

### 7. **HIERARCHY** @ 4.00 - ✗ REJECT
**Composite Score: 54.2/100** | **Filters Passed: 2/4**

**Why Rejected:** Despite being second-favorite, Hierarchy has **0% course form (0 from 9)** and **0% going form (0 from 9)**. The horse has **never won at Kempton or on this going**. At 4.00, there's no value for a horse that's proven it can't handle the conditions.

**VELO'S VERDICT:** "Second-favorite with zero course wins from nine tries? That's not bad luck, that's a pattern. The market's wrong here. Pass."

---

### 8. **DANGER ALERT** @ 7.00 - ✗ REJECT
**Composite Score: 45.4/100** | **Filters Passed: 3/4**

**Why Rejected:** Strong value (+35.7%) and good course/going form (25% each), but **form score of -20/100** with multiple poor runs (2 in last 3) is a deal-breaker. Trainer George Baker is **0% in last 14 days (0 from 10)**. Too many red flags.

**VELO'S VERDICT:** "The stats say yes, the form says no. When form and stats clash, I side with recent evidence. Cold trainer seals it."

---

### 9-11. **LERWICK, TREACHEROUS, LIPSINK** - ✗ REJECT
**Composite Scores: 38.8, 33.6, 32.7/100**

**Why Rejected:** All three failed to pass minimum filter requirements (only 1 filter passed). Weak statistical profiles, poor form cycles, and insufficient value edges.

---

## BETTING RECOMMENDATIONS

### 🎯 PRIMARY SELECTIONS

#### **1. MC LOVEN @ 9.00**
- **Bet Type:** PRIME EACH-WAY
- **Stake:** 2% of bank
- **Terms:** Top 4 places, 1/5 odds
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM-HIGH
- **Reasoning:** Hot trainer (29% L14), improving speed figures (+4.7), good value edge (+18.9%). The lack of course/going form is a concern, but the trainer's recent record suggests he's placed this horse to win.

#### **2. HARRY'S HALO @ 19.00**
- **Bet Type:** LONGSHOT EACH-WAY
- **Stake:** 1% of bank
- **Terms:** Top 3 places, 1/4 odds
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Reasoning:** Recent win, consistent placings, strong value (+24.7%). Declining speed figures are a worry, but at 19.00, the each-way terms provide excellent insurance. This is a place bet disguised as a win bet.

#### **3. ONE MORE DREAM @ 15.00**
- **Bet Type:** WIN ONLY (Small Stake)
- **Stake:** 1.5% of bank
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Reasoning:** Highest value edge in race (+53.3%), exceptional going form (40% win rate), excellent distance record (23%). The poor recent form is concerning, but the statistical profile is too strong to ignore. This is a pure value play.

---

### 🔍 WATCH BETS (Optional - Outside System Parameters)

#### **4. TYGER BAY @ 5.00**
- **Bet Type:** WATCH ONLY (or small win bet if you must)
- **Stake:** 0% bank (or 0.5% if betting)
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM-HIGH
- **Reasoning:** Market favorite with excellent course/going/distance record. Still shows +40% value, which is remarkable for a favorite. The issue? **Below 8.00 odds = outside system parameters**. If you're betting favorites, this is the one, but it's not our game.

#### **5. EL BUFALO @ 34.00**
- **Bet Type:** WATCH ONLY (or tiny saver bet)
- **Stake:** 0% bank (or 0.25% if betting)
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM-HIGH (for a longshot)
- **Reasoning:** Massive value (+37.1%), 33% going win rate, recent win. At 34.00, this is **above system parameters (max 25.00)**. But the value is undeniable. If you're playing savers, this is it. Don't expect it to win, but don't be shocked if it does.

#### **6. INVINCIBLE SPEED @ 10.00**
- **Bet Type:** WATCH ONLY (or small E/W)
- **Stake:** 0% bank (or 1% if betting)
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Reasoning:** Best form in race, recent win, improving. But trainer is 0% L14 and no course form. This is a 50/50 call. If you like form horses, bet it. If you like statistics, pass.

## RED FLAGS & RISK FACTORS

### ⚠ **RACE-LEVEL RISKS:**
1. **Competitive Handicap:** 11-runner field with 6 horses meeting system criteria = no standout
2. **All-Weather Variability:** AW form can be unpredictable, especially with weather changes
3. **Trainer Form Variance:** Mix of hot trainers (Dow 29%) and cold trainers (Loughnane 0%, Baker 0%)
4. **Market Uncertainty:** Several horses showing value suggests market hasn't settled

### ⚠ **HORSE-SPECIFIC RISKS:**
- **Mc Loven:** No course/going form (first time conditions)
- **One More Dream:** Multiple poor runs recently (form: 586210)
- **Invincible Speed:** Cold trainer (0% L14), no course form
- **Tyger Bay:** Jockey 0% L14 (Ryan Kavanagh)
- **El Bufalo:** Massive odds (34.00) = low probability despite value

---

## VELO'S FINAL VERDICT

*"This is a value hunter's race, not a certainty seeker's race. Six horses meet system criteria, which means the market's confused - and when the market's confused, we profit. But don't mistake confusion for opportunity without discipline.*

*My core play is **Mc Loven E/W at 9.00**. Hot trainer, improving horse, and the odds are fair. I'm adding **Harry's Halo E/W at 19.00** as the place thief - won't win, but will cash.*

*The wildcard is **One More Dream at 15.00**. The numbers scream 'back me' but the form screams 'run away.' I'm trusting the 40% going win rate over recent form, but I'm not loading up. Small stake, big potential.*

*As for **Tyger Bay** - the favorite's probably going to win or place, but at 5.00, it's not our game. We hunt value, not favorites.*

*And **El Bufalo**? If you've got 25p burning a hole in your pocket, throw it on. At 34.00, it's a lottery ticket with better odds than the lottery.*

*Remember: We don't need to win every race. We need to win over 20 races. This is race #2 in our journey. Discipline over desperation. Value over vanity.*

*The line is drawn. Now we wait."*
